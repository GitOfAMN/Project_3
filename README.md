## Getting Started

Trello: https://trello.com/b/bIy5jvJc/project-3# <br>
Heroku: WIP

## Unsolved Probelm(s)

- Setting up the delivery aspect of it once you click checkout and populating fields for delivery address, then cost for delivery based on this.<br>
- Would have added more menu and menu list items.<br>
- Striggled with the design and had another vision I would have ideally liked to execute over this one but I just didn't have the time or mental capacity.

## Future Enhancements

The delivery feature mentioned above and adding more product as well as getting the images to format consistently
